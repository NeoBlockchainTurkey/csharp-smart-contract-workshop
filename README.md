## Workshop for programming smart contracts with .NET, C# and Visual Studio

The original idea as well as the structure, and content of this workshop was created by Chris Hager (@metachris) for the NEO Python community: [Workshop for programming smart contracts with Python (python-smart-contract-workshop)](https://github.com/CityOfZion/python-smart-contract-workshop) ([https://github.com/CityOfZion/python-smart-contract-workshop](https://github.com/CityOfZion/python-smart-contract-workshop)).

This C# version of the workshop, [Workshop for programming smart contracts with .NET, C# and Visual Studio (csharp-smart-contract-workshop)](https://github.com/mwherman2000/csharp-smart-contract-workshop) ([https://github.com/mwherman2000/csharp-smart-contract-workshop](https://github.com/mwherman2000/csharp-smart-contract-workshop)), is a parallel effort based on Chris's original [workshop content](https://github.com/CityOfZion/python-smart-contract-workshop) (March 2018).

## Purpose

* Hands-on smart contract development workshop: .NET/C#/Visual Studio on the NEO Blockchain

## Goals, Non-Goals and Assumptions

* Target audience: Architects and Developers who are new to the NEO Blockchain platform
* Background: Very little or no previous NEO or .NET/C#/Visual Studio Experience
* Background: Understand basic 1st and 2nd generation blockchain technologies: hashing, blocks, mining, etc.
* Provide you with a basic level of awareness and understanding of NEO smart contract development
* Help create a strong NEO Blockchain Developer community – helping each other

## Principles

* Provide reliable documentation: timely, accurate, visual, and complete
* Save as much of a person's time as possible
* Use open source software whenever possible

## Drivers

* Need in the NEO .NET developer community to have concise and easy-to-follow documentation to enable people to get up to speed developing NEO smart contracts in as short a time as possible

### Preparation

1. Join Discord NEO Developer Community on Discord by clicking on one of the following links: 
   * https://discord.gg/gqCYeup or https://discord.gg/4TQujHj 
2. Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition 2017. This version is free to download and free to use. It is an excellent IDE for C# smart contract development from here: 
   * https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/
3. Download and install the .NET 4.7.1 Dev Pack from here:
   *  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56119
4. Build the NEO Debugger Tools
   * Download the NEO Debugger Tools source code from here:    
      * https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-debugger-tools/archive/master.zip
   * Create a new folder on your hard drive – for example `c:\repos`   
   * Copy `master.zip` into `c:\repos`.
   * Unzip `master.zip` and build the NEO Debugger Tools following the steps in the diagram below.

5. Lastly, update your Windows PATH environment variable to include the path to the NEO Compiler `neon.exe` by typing the following into the Windows command prompt [[Reference](https://superuser.com/questions/939232/how-to-change-environment-variable-when-the-option-is-inactive)]:

```
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Repos\neo-debugger-tools-master\NEO-Compiler\bin\Debug"
```

**NOTE** Use the `setx` command - not the `set` command.

**NOTE** Do not use an `=` (equals) sign.

**NOTE** If you unzipped `master.zip` into a different folder or onto a different hard drive, change the `setx` command to use the folder you chose.
